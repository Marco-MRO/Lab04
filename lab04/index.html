      <h2>Why BSc Creative Media?</h2>
      <p>
        Our programme delivers interdisciplinary teaching by crossing the boundaries among 
        digital media, design, and computer science, which bridges the creative and technical sides 
        of computer-based media art production. Students will be trained in computer graphics, 
        digital imaging, mobile media, user-interface (UI) and user-experience (UX) design, 
        computer games and interactive media.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Target</h2>
      <p>
        This major produces creative media professionals who are proficient in computing 
        technology. Students also gain a solid foundation in creative processes, including game 
        design, UI/UX design, animation, computer graphics, storytelling, video, sound, photography, 
        installation and interactive digital media production.
      </p>
      <p>
        This major combines core courses from the School of Creative Media and the Department 
        of Computer Science to produce graduates who are able to bridge the gap between the 
        technical and artistic sides of the media field. Graduates will be capable of using the latest 
        computing and media technologies in the creation of various media including computer 
        games, UI/UX, animation, special effects, sound, wireless and mobile media, internet 
        application, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, and interactive installation.
      </p>

      <h2>Entrance Requirements for Direct / Non-JUPAS Applicants</h2>
      <p>
        To be considered for admission, you must satisfy the General Entrance Requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        For senior-year (Advanced Standing II) admission, applicants are normally expected to have 
        completed an Associate Degree/Higher Diploma in a relevant discipline with a cumulative 
        grade point average (CGPA) of ≥3.0 or an equivalent overall mark, or a credit award.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applicants may be invited to attend an interview and/or other assessment processes so 
        that the School of Creative Media (SCM) can gauge their creative potential. All direct 
        applicants for SCM programmes (1041/1042/1043/1044/1456A/1468A/1471A) are strongly 
        encouraged to submit a portfolio of creative work via an online system to SCM. Please refer 
        to the School’s portfolio web page for the most up-to-date submission deadlines and 
        specifications for the portfolio. Portfolio materials may include still photography, 
        paintings/drawings, sculptures, musical compositions/performances, films/videos, software, 
        multimedia productions, academic or creative writing, science projects or other forms of 
        imaginative activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consideration may be given to employment records, travel and other examples of life 
        experience.

      <h2>Curriculum Structure</h2>
      <p>
        This major combines core courses offered by the Department of Computer Science and 
        the School of Creative Media, providing students with a solid background in both areas. 
        Students have the opportunity to mix with students in both academic units while developing 
        teamwork skills and a true understanding of both fields.

      <p>
        Computer Science courses include computer programming, data structures, data storage, 
        networking, applied algorithms, software engineering, computer graphics and AI game 
        programming. These courses equip students with a solid background in computer science 
        and programming, enabling them to develop software for the media industry.

        Through courses and final-year projects, students have ample opportunities to practise 
        their technical and creative skills, work in teams and develop interesting digital media 
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students can also take free electives or minor(s) according to their personal or career 
        interests to fulfil the credit requirement for graduation. A strong Student Advising Scheme
